# camera conversor
gets the camera, each pixel to a value of 0 to 255 (black to white), iterates through an array with some chars, then adds it accordingly
so making it a visual effect looking like it's converting, but, in reality, just checking each pixel

yeah it's kinda converting now if you think abt it ðŸ˜…
