# camera conversor
gets the camera, each pixel to a value of 0 to 255 (black to white), iterates through an array with some chars, then adds it accordingly
so making it a visual effect looking

## how to use
on cmd, load the .py<br>
```cmd
camera_ascii.py
```
it'll load a width changer, two windows and a cmd
the cmd is the "converted" camera, the colored one is the main camera, the gray one is what i used to explain the program (in a school science fair)<br>
just resize the cmd window and have fun with it
